# Numeronym

Automatically changes words to numbers if it detects them.
It converts words to [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) which then is used to change the numbers in for similar sounding parts of the words. 

For Example:

`Hate` in the nation --> `H8` in the nation
